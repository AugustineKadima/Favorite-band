                My most favorite band in Kenya are Sauti Sol. I have been their number one fan 
                over the years simply because they represent the Kenyan culture in their decent music.

                <p>
                     <strong>Bien-Aime</strong>  (French for beloved) <strong>Baraza</strong>  is a <em>vocalist, songwriter </em> and  <em>guitarist.</em> 
                     His style of singing is soulful and his songwriting skills celebrated  by many.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Since Sauti Sol’s inception in 2006, Bien-Aime has remained active in the  group and part of the 
                    creation of Sauti Sol two albums: Mwanzo (2008) and  Sol Filosofia (2011). Bien-Aime occasionally 
                    writes songs for other artists  like Elani, Amos & Josh and Wendy Kimani.
                </p>

                <p>
                    He says of songs from Sauti Sol’s first two albums: Mwanzo and Sol Filosofia, 
                    “I love to write songs. And women inspire me. My thought process equates songs to
                     women; to an extent I call our songs my women. Lazizi is the hot girl at the bar.
                     Zosi is the good sweet girl who goes to church. Mama Papa and Soma Kijana are the 
                     voices of my mother.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    “While on stage, these hit singles are among my trophies. Some women like Wera, Subira, Mapacha, 
                    Awinja and Asubuhi are wife material–girls who knew me in the hood before the lights, camera and 
                    action. They remind me of Sauti Sol days before success and the magical struggle that our music has
                     been. They are show for sacrifice and represent the road we’ve treaded.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    Bien-Aime studied Journalism and Media Studies at the United States International
                     University and graduated in 2011.

                    the band has played an instrumental role during tours

                    “I write music differently as compared to any other artists out there.    
                    Much as my music will rule the world, heroism and power are at the least of my priorities.
                     I simply want people to feel what I feel when am doing my music.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Savara has produced most of the songs from Sauti Sol’s new album #LiveandDieinAfrika

                    <strong>Willis Austin Chimano</strong>  is a <em>vocalist, keytar </em> and <em>saxophone player</em> . His  deep voice 
                    and flamboyant style makes him stand out in the group.  Before the formation of 
                    Sauti Sol, Chimano contested and won in the  annual Fête de la Musique music 
                    competition at the French Cultural  Centre, while studying French. After the 
                    competition Chimano went to  Paris for a two-week experience where he got to sample 
                    new music  translations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Since Sauti Sol’s inception in 2006, Chimano has remained active in the  group and part

                </p>

                <p>
                    Chimano says: “I met Sauti Sol members individually in three different scenarios. 
                    And it’s the dynamics of how we all came together as a band that still baffle me 
                    irrespective of the fact that three of us were in the same high school. It was pure 
                    serendipity that despite different career dreams, music brought us together in a way 
                    inexplicable.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    Chimano graduated from University of Nairobi with a degree in Journalism & Media 
                    Studies. He remains active in Sauti Sol’s Soma Soma Initiative which champions 
                    education among youth.
